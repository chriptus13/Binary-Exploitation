# Binary Exploitation

This repo contains some experiments for learning Binary Exploitation.

* [Buffer Overflows](/Buffer-Overflows)
* [Format Strings](/Format-Strings)

## Running

There is a Dockerfile which you can build locally and run your experiments regardless of your host OS.
All files will be added to `Binary-Exploitation` folder inside container's root folder.

## ASLR

One thing to consider is that [ASLR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization) (Address Space Layout Randomization) depends on your machine and not on the container.
Therefore when running experiments that require ASLR on/off remember to turn it on/off.

For Linux systems:

```bash
# Enable ASLR
echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
# Disable ASLR
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

For Windows systems see [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-security/turn-on-mandatory-aslr-in-windows-security/m-p/1186989).

For Mac systems couldn't find a documented way as per [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23897963/documented-way-to-disable-aslr-on-os-x) Stack Overflow question.
